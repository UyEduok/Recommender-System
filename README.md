# Recommender-System

Description:
This GitHub repository contains the code and resources for a movie recommender system. The recommender system utilizes three different approaches: collaborative filtering, popularity-based filtering, and content-based filtering, to provide personalized movie recommendations to users.

Features:

Collaborative Filtering: The system leverages user-based and item-based collaborative filtering techniques to recommend movies based on user preferences and similar user behavior.
Popularity-Based Filtering: The system incorporates popularity-based filtering to suggest movies that are popular among a wide range of users.
Content-Based Filtering: The system employs content-based filtering to recommend movies based on their content attributes such as genre, actors, directors, and plot keywords.
Implementation:

The codebase includes modules for data preprocessing, similarity calculation, and recommendation generation.
Various machine learning algorithms and libraries are utilized for collaborative filtering and content-based filtering.
The system supports both offline and online recommendation generation.
The repository also includes datasets and example scripts for training and evaluating the recommender system.
Usage:

Clone the repository and set up the required dependencies.
Preprocess the movie data and build the recommendation models.
Utilize the recommendation models to generate personalized movie recommendations for users.
Evaluate and fine-tune the system's performance using appropriate metrics.
Contributions:
Contributions and improvements to the movie recommender system are welcome. Users can contribute by enhancing the recommendation algorithms, implementing additional filtering techniques, or improving the overall performance and user experience.

By leveraging collaborative filtering, popularity-based filtering, and content-based filtering techniques, this movie recommender system aims to deliver accurate and personalized movie recommendations to users, enhancing their movie-watching experience.
